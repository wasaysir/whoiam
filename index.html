							<h2>Multiple Intelligences</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>My intelligences</strong> represent me because of how they represent my talents and how those talents align with my aspirations and personality. My intelligences in order are:</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon fa-list-ol">Mathematical or Logical</li>
								<li class="icon fa-male">Intrapersonal</li>
								<li class="icon fa-pencil">Visual</li>
								<li class="icon fa-cube">Kinesthetic</li>
								<li class="icon fa-group">Interpersonal</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">Verbal</li>
                                <li class="icon fa-music">Musical</li>
                                <li class="icon fa-leaf">Naturalist</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I enjoy math a lot and love logical activities such as coding, which is why i made a website. I am very knowledgeable about my own limitations, I just choose to believe they don't exist, and know what I aspire to become. I find visualizing a concept makes it easier to interpret. I'm very adept at solving spatial problems thanks to my fondness of rubik's cubes. I find it difficult to function in groups thanks to my introvertedness. I am very at loss when it comes to words, music and nature and I generally don't like those activities.</p>

										</div>
                            <p><strong>I am fairly left brained</strong> but I will admit that there are portions of me that are heavily right sided. I take part in and enjoy all of the activities I mentioned above and I find myself very passionate about those activities. I think that the left brained part of me transfers into my personality and in the activities that I take part in that are more right brained I take a more logical and 'left-brained' approach to them such as focusing on what logically is pleasing to the eye.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/introvertedness.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p><strong>I am evenly split</strong> as an introvert and an extrovert, where I find that I have an urge to talk to people but also find it pleasant to have some time to myself and reflect and think about my own ideas. I think that I could be extroverted depending on who I'm talking to, if I'm talking to an introvert I find myself more outgoing but with an extrovert more timid. I personally want to be more outgoing and extroverted so I try to assert myself in situations that allow me to work on my speaking and interpersonal skills.</p>

										</div>
                            <p><strong>My colour personality is </strong>green which means that I am very logical, ordered and structured. I don't work well in groups and don't work very well in relating to others' emotions. I, as a green, prioritize certain traits such as logical arguments as well as activities that are intellectually stimulating as opposed to activities that involve physical activities or require emotions. I value perfection and reading as an introverted activity. I value science and logical activities, as well as introverted activities.</p>

                                        <p>My 16 personalities test concludes that I am an ISTJ. I agree with this because I am, arguably, introverted, I can be empathic and I think very crucially on topics that interest me while being judgemental and suspicious of most of people's actions. </p>

                                        <p>The Myers-Briggs Test had concluded that I was an INTJ -T. I agree with this because of the fact that I am partially introverted, I rely on my intuition often, I think very often about different big issues and am very judgemental.</p>

										<h3>Differences</h3>

                                        <p>The differences between the Myers-Briggs and the 16 Personalities test are that I am a sensing person instead of a thinking person, I think that I am more of an intuitive personality but that is a biased view of me, I want to believe that I am completely rational and logical but I have morals and empathy and when given the occasion I can relate to people's troubles. The similarites I believe strongly represent me, I think that I am a coin toss between introverted and extroverted but when deciding which is more prominent, I would definitely choose introverted. I am definitely judgemental as opposed to perceiving because I want to more reactive when it comes to life so I take a more proactive approach to life.</p>
